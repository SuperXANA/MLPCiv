MLP Civilization is Magic (MLPCiv)

A fanstasy mod brining the magic of harmony and friendship to the infinite realities of Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword!

# What is it?
This is a modification to the popular 2007 PC video game to incorporate fantasy elements, including characters from alternative universes and the powers of magic, into Civilization.
Go forth and conquer your world!

This game mod is a work-in-progress since 2017. I've merged in an expansive AI mod called AdvCiv by f1rpo.

# Who can you play as?
Specifically, you can explore the history of main characters like Fluttershy or even fan-favorite background ponies like Lyra Heartstrings! 
Or, change the course of time with ponies hailing from worlds similar to Equestria but with crucial differences... 

For exmaple, what if Twilight Sparkle became possessed by evil, demonic forces? What if King Sombra conquered the lands of Equestria?
What if the Conversion Beureau descended upon the world to remake it in their image?

Just download and play, explore the universe you create in Civilization IV!

# Why did you create this?
I love Civilization IV, it's one of my favorite video games ever. I wanted a mod similar to Fall From Heaven II with elements of magic and a world teeming with dark, exciting high-fantasy. However I found none that suited my interest in characters from fictional media...
So I decided to base a mod on clanky4's MLP Civilization is Magic mod and develop my own wonderous game mod myself.
